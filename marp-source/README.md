# Marp Source Files

These are the source files for the lecture slide decks in this workshop. They're written in [Marp](https://marp.app/) markdown format.

**Don't view them directly here** — the raw markdown won't look right on GitHub.

Instead, use the **Lecture** links in the [main README](../README.md) to view the properly rendered slides.
